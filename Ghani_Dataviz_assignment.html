		The term Burmese Refugees immediately conjures up the image of the Rohingya Muslims.
		The community was covered extensively by the media in 2015, when the Rohingya started fleeing the country.
		The Burmese Refugee crisis is more than that.
		The article highlights other ethnicities and groups who fled the country due to militarization.
		As Democratic reforms began in the country in the country in 2011, the article discusses the many reasons these people fled Burma in the first place
		and what might be in store for them if they return.
		It also provides an overview of the different ethnicities of people fleeing from Burma and seeking refuge elsewhere.

		The article discusses repatriation of Burmese refugees from Thailand, which started in October 2016.
		It also provides a brief overview of the refugees who have been living in Thailand for over 30 years now.
		It goes on to mention that while repatriation might be taking place it is unlikely that a large group of refugees will go back to Burma
		since the political situation there is still precarious for these people.

			<p>
				The article uses the story of Thanga from Burma to highlight the many problems Burmese refugees face in India.
				Thanga, is from the Chin ethnicity and is Christian, which is why he had to flee in July 2007, after he got into an alteraction with a military officer.
				Delhi, in India is home to over 5000 Chin refugees, which is why Thanga also made the city his home. UNHCR assistance to these refugees is limited.
				The organization only provides assistance to the disabled.
