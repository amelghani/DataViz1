		<div>
		<p>
		The article uses the story of Thanga from Burma to highlight the many problems Burmese refugees face in India.
		Thanga, is from the Chin ethnicity and is Christian, which is why he had to flee in July 2007, after he got into an alteraction with a military officer.
		Delhi, in India is home to over 5000 Chin refugees, which is why Thanga also made the city his home. UNHCR assistance to these refugees is limited.
		The organization only provides assistance to the disabled.
